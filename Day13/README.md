876. Middle of the Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
Example 1:
<img width="691" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de827375-5072-461a-9d79-4a622aedd9df" />
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:
<img width="840" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd90502-33a6-4936-b5bf-5745c9574b53" />
<img width="835" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/878af27b-e974-42f5-bed5-bb6d0130cc21" />
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
